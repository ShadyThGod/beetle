## FAQ

### Why is this not on Chrome?
The extension itself is completely compatible with Chrome, but I haven't been able to publish it to the Chrome Web Store. Chrome doesn't allow extensions to be loaded from the filesystem; only from the Web Store itself. However, the Web Store charges a registration fee, which to be blunt with you, I cannot afford. And yes, I know it's only $5 but I'm just a student living with my parents. I don't earn any money yet and even the work I put on GitHub is free of cost.

- Will I ever put on the Store then? 

Maybe, yes. You can expect to see this on the store by the end of this year or start of next year, if the extension doesn't completely break and is maintainable.
   
### How do I install it on Chrome?
Right now your best bet would be to download the .zip file, unzip it and load it using the developer mode on the chrome://extensions page.
